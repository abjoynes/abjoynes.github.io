      <h2>
      I attend The City School and will be graduating in June of 2018. I would like major in Computer Science or do a double major in Business and Mechanical Engineering.
        <br>
      I began my love for STEM when I was younger with my father, we would rebuild TVs, rewire them, and he would teach me all he knew about computers.
     This has led me to go to various camps, workshops, and scour the internet to learn about coding and engineering. I have plans to own my own company that focuses on STEM things like website design, microchip design, and educating youth about STEM.
      </h2> 
      <br>
      <h2> Another major aspect of my life is sports. I've been playing sports since I was five years old and never looked back.

  Since I was five, I have stuck with wearing the number 6, 12, or 23 to receive good luck from sports gods Lebron James, Michael Jordan, and my father. So they have given me much great strengths in every game I play.
