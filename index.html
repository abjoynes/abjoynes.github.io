      <h2>
      I attend The City School and will be graduating in June of 2018. I would like major in Computer Science or do a double major in Business and Mechanical Engineering.
        <br>
      I began my love for STEM when I was younger with my father, we would rebuild TVs, rewire them, and he would teach me all he knew about computers.
      <br>  This has led me to go to various camps, workshops, and scoor the internet to learn about coding and engineering.
